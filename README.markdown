# GletLook

A Quick Look plugin for GeekTool Geeklet .glet files.

GeekTool is a preference pane for Mac OS X that allows you to display different kinds of information on your desktop. These bits of information are called Geeklets, and they can be text, images, files, and the output of shell commands.

## Installation

Just drag GletLook.qlgenerator to /Library/QuickLook or ~/Library/QuickLook. You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.

It sometimes take Quick Look a while to recognise the new plugin. Try logging out and in again, or alternatively type

    qlmanage -r

into the Terminal and press Return.

## System Requirements

Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
